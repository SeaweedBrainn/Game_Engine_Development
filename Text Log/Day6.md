# Day 6
### August 31, 2025

First I started by attempting to learn about the MacOS terminal because for some reason I still didnt know nothing. I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkoEHvG3GI8) and it actually taught me a lot of stuf. From  my new found knowledge I found that the MacOS interface is basically a GUI to do everything thats possible in the terminal. Here are some commands so I can remember stuff in the future too LOL.

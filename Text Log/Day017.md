Today I just wanted to refactor some of the code using forward decleration of classes as well as modify the Shader and Texture classes to use move semantics so we get a bit more flexibility to allow us to create temporary objects and assign them since that was dissallowed by removing the copy constructor and assignment operator.

> ### Move Semantics
I found out that this is good if i wanna do smthn like `shaderObject = Shader("somePath")` etc so I implemented this for shaders and textures. I also refactored the BasicShader and the Material class to use the move semantics and make it a bit easier. The Basic Shader class now also has a default Material with a purple Unity color and no texture in case someone decides not to pass in a material.

<hr />

> ### Forward Declerations
Forward decleration involves declaring a class at the top of a header file instead of importing it to prevent circular dependencies. The files can then be imported in the cpp files. Forward decleration doesnt work if one of the member variables is the class you wanna use.

I tried following the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xmpEdbEPpc) and did manage to get a window up and displaying stuff. I used [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download) and [Conan](https://conan.io) in VS Code to make it work. Honestly I didn't understand anything whatever he did, he had provided a [github repo](https://github.com/furkansarihan/virtual_universe) with the code which I just got into my project.

I did not learn anything about the setup and that makes me mad. Now I am thinking I should first dwelve in a side quest on learning clang++, Cmake, and Conan2. After I have sufficient knowledge in them to be able to do stuff in them is when I will return back to this. I will also see if making a simple game using those tools is necessary before returning back to this. Honestly, it shouldn't be since I just need to learn the basics of those things to understand setup. Peace out.

# Game_Engine_Development
### [Link to project repository](https://github.com/SeaweedBrainn/GameEngineProject)
I have decided to create my own game engine. I have almost no experience in anything like this and it is supposed to take a long time. I will be logging my journey in audio files and in text where necessary along with all the files. My goal is to finish this project in 3 years before my graduation. I will not be using AI if I can help it.

# Game_Engine_Development
I have decided to create my own game engine. I have almost no experience in anything like this and it is supposed to take a long time. I will be logging my journey in audio files and in text where necessary along with all the files. My goal is to finish this project in 3 years before my graduation.

#### Initial Commit: August 23, 2025
### Game Engine features to include:
  - Full 3D Game Design Support
  - An entirely new physics system
  - Support for creating multiplayer games

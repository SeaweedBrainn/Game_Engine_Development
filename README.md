# Game_Engine_Development
I have decided to create my own game engine. I have almost no experience in anything like this and it is supposed to take a long time. I will be logging my journey in audio files and in text where necessary along with all the files. My goal is to finish this project in 3 years before my graduation. I will not be using AI if I can help it.

## Game Engine features to include:
  - Full 3D Game Design Support

  - Support for creating multiplayer games

## Planning Roadmap
  - #### Bootstrapping
    - Opening a window in the OS
    - Debug Logging
    - File System Access - Reading and Writing
  - #### Networking
    - Set up client and server and get communication between them working
    - Sending text packets back and forth by TCP and UDP
  - #### Graphics API
    - OpenGL, Vulcan, or DirectX
    - Basic things like rendering a triangle

    - Design a basic pipeline
    - Determine how assets will be imported at a high level
  - #### Handling Gamescreen - UI interaction
  - #### World and Scene Graph
  - #### Implementing Object State for Client and Server
    - If an object moves from one point to another, how do all clients see it?
  - #### Set up a Physics Systems
  - #### Making Physics system and Networking system interact with each other
  - #### Tools
    - Level Editors
    - Asset Importers
    - Any tool to make content for the engine
